<br/>

This is some sample code which shows you how to fully implement a tree control using KnockoutJs.

<br/>

#### This tree control has great features like:
* Flat input data
* Dynamic node object properties
* Sorting by node object properties
* Searching by node object properties
* Searching by like patterns (case sensitive/insensitive) or whole words
* Searching by regular expressions
* Expanding to matching nodes
* Highlighting matching nodes
* Expanding/Collapsing
* Adding nodes
* Extensibility

<br/>

It was taken into consideration while writing the code to separate the business-related code from the core implementation as far as possible without adding too much complexity to the whole solution. You can take this library as a base which you can modify to be adapted to your needs.
